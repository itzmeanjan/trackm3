A Live Location Tracker built with Electron, WebSocket &amp; Flutter

If you like this project, please be kind enough to put :star: on.

## idea
Building a Live Location Tracker, which helps you to track device(s) / person(s) in real-time and visualizing that on Map can be really great.

> Isn't :thinking: ?

> Well that's what we're gonna do here.

## model
We gonna simply make a Desktop Application using [ElectronJS](http://electronjs.org/), which will display a Map, along with Live Location of currently trackable device(s).

Well there should be a listening service, to be built along with Desktop Application, for handling real-time data feed from trackable devices. For that  I'll be using [NodeJS http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), along with [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws).

And last but not least, a mobile application, which will be used for tracking a Person. In this case, I'm going to use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for building an Android Application. You might think of targetting other platform(s) / device(s).

You're very welcome to contribute in this project.

Coming soon ... :sunglasses:
